# [Ark Survival Evolved](https://store.steampowered.com/app/346110/ARK_Survival_Evolved/)
"Stranded on the shores of a mysterious island, you must learn to survive. Use your cunning to kill or tame the primeval creatures roaming the land, and encounter other players to survive, dominate... and escape!"


## About the game
As a man or woman, alone with others you have to survive and thrive through not only each other but over 100+ tamable prehistoric and/or custom mythical creatures where you explore, fight and conquer together all to uncover this wild and wonderful lands sectres and hidden treasures

# Breeding Doc Explanation
I almost always 100% games I enjoy, although ARK doesn't technically have a 100% besides steam achievements and maybe fighting all the bosses the game has to offer this doesn't touch every mecahnic that the game has to over, especially the highly important breeding mechanic

I will use the breeding mechanic to not just breed every animal once but, to those unfimiliar with ARK's breeding mecahnics, ARK has a feature where every baby born from breeding has a chance to "mutate" which increases a random stat point, but it also plots a random color out of ARKs 100+ colors on a random color region. I will make it my goal to breed all the dinos until each dino has a mutated color on each of it's color regions 

This Document is a template for anyone else who cares to join me in this challenge to mark off which dinos are completed
